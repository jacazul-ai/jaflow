# Agent Workflow Reference for Parity Tests

## Purpose

This document defines the evidence boundary for verifying that the native Go
Jaflow engine preserves the observable behavior of the reference `tw-flow`
workflow. It is a test reference, not a generated agent prompt and not a
replacement for the reference implementation.

The parity target is behavior. Jaflow may use different packages, storage, and
process boundaries as long as the supported behavior, safety rules, state
transitions, and actionable errors remain compatible.

## Reference Repository

The behavioral reference is the `jacazul-ai-cli` repository:

```text
~/source/jacazul-ai/jacazul-ai-cli/master/
```

Use the reference checkout in an isolated test environment. Never use the
operator's real Taskwarrior data, home configuration, cache, session files, or
external services while running parity scenarios.

## Authority Order

When investigating a behavior, use the following order:

1. Reference tests under `tests/` define executable observable contracts.
2. The `jacazul/` package explains the reference implementation mechanism.
3. Reference documentation explains user-facing intent and terminology.
4. `AGENTS.md`, skills, and templates define agent and workflow operating
   rules, but do not by themselves prove a command's domain behavior.

If a test and an implementation detail disagree, preserve the tested behavior
and record a compatibility decision when the difference is material.

## Agent and Workflow Resolution Chain

The reference agent behavior is assembled through several layers:

```text
scripts/configure
  setup: directories, links, and initial templates
        |
        v
scripts/bootstrap/
  runtime: environment, session, settings, and resource detection
        |
        v
jacazul/hatch/templates/
  source of generated skills and agent prompts
        |
        v
agents/ and skills/
  generated client artifacts
        |
        v
tw-flow and taskp
  workflow state, safety restrictions, and task operations
```

Generated agent files must not be edited directly. Changes to prompt or skill
behavior belong in `jacazul/hatch/templates/` and require regeneration. Agent
prompt generation is outside the Jaflow domain; Jaflow should implement the
stable workflow contracts consumed by any client.

The current reference repository still describes Taskwarrior wrappers and
`tw-flow`. The Jaflow target uses native persistence and domain APIs. Any
Taskwarrior compatibility code in the migration is a transitional boundary,
not a source-of-truth requirement for the target engine.

## Test Coverage Map

| Behavior area | Primary reference evidence | Required Jaflow proof |
|---|---|---|
| Entry points and project isolation | `tests/core_test.py` | Subprocess routing, exit status, project-scoped state, and cross-project non-observation |
| Lifecycle, focus, context, tickets, dashboards, modes, handoffs, and completion safety | `tests/flow_test.py` | Command/API contracts plus persisted state and actionable errors |
| Cache storage, TTL, refresh, invalidation, filters, and sessions | `tests/cache_test.py` | Key boundaries, expiry signals, force refresh, and session isolation |
| Vaccination, archive auditing, quoting, and raw command restrictions | `tests/security_test.py` | Rejection behavior, guidance, and no unsafe bypass |
| Session listing | `tests/test_session_list.py` | Correct current and historical session views without cross-session leakage |
| Backlog behavior | `tests/test_backlog.py` | Backlog transitions, visibility, and plan isolation |
| Recently closed history | `tests/test_recently_closed.py` | Correct completion history and output ordering |
| Roadmap initialization guard | `tests/test_roadmap_init_guard.py` | Refuse invalid initialization and preserve existing roadmap state |
| Agent artifact generation | `tests/test_hatch.py`, agent-directory tests | Only when client/bootstrap behavior is explicitly in scope; test templates and generated output at their boundary |

The reference tests named above are the minimum map for the current parity
phase. Add a focused regression test when a previously unprotected behavior is
discovered.

## Contract Comparison

A parity test must compare both sides of the boundary:

```text
same isolated inputs
        |
        +--> reference flow
        |       output + error + state
        |
        +--> native Jaflow flow
                output + error + state
```

Capture and compare:

- command or API result;
- process exit status;
- stdout and stderr ownership;
- actionable `ACTION:` guidance on failures;
- state transitions and persisted records;
- task, initiative, dependency, annotation, focus, session, and cache scope;
- ordering where the user can observe it;
- security restrictions and rejection behavior.

Do not compare implementation accidents such as Python stack traces, SQLite
layout details, internal class names, or numeric Taskwarrior IDs. Compare the
contract visible to a client or operator.

## Isolation Requirements

Each test scenario must use controlled temporary state:

- a temporary home and Jaflow runtime root;
- an isolated project identity;
- isolated session identity when session behavior is under test;
- temporary databases and cache directories;
- fake external commands or local test servers where required;
- no live network, production ticket, user credentials, or real workflow data.

A fixture that merely proves its own files are separate is not enough. The
parity test must assert both directions:

```text
project A cannot observe project B
project B cannot observe project A
session A cannot observe session B
```

The real command or public API must cross the boundary under test. Test
harness helpers provide isolation; they are not proof of feature behavior.

## Red-Green-Refactor-Mutation Loop

For each missing or suspect behavior:

1. **Red:** add a valid failing contract test based on the reference behavior.
2. **Green:** implement the smallest native Jaflow change that passes it.
3. **Refactor:** simplify ownership and boundaries without changing the
   contract.
4. **Mutation check:** intentionally break the protected rule and verify that
   the test fails rather than passing vacuously.
5. **Parity review:** compare the result with the reference test and mechanism.

A passing test without a meaningful failure mutation does not demonstrate that
the assertion protects the behavior.

## Context and Annotation Contracts

The distributed and local context relevant to parity includes structured
annotations and their inheritance behavior:

- `DECISION`;
- `RESEARCH`;
- `OUTCOME`;
- `LESSON`;
- `HANDOFF`;
- `QUESTION`;
- `HYPOTHESIS`.

The current compatibility contract requires:

- semantic note aliases normalize to uppercase annotation kinds;
- notes can be listed and deleted by timestamp;
- context and status inherit supported annotations through dependency edges;
- inheritance is dependency-first and recursive;
- direct external ticket references take precedence over inherited references;
- handoff starts a target task when necessary and records `HANDOFF`;
- notes remain allowed on completed tasks while lifecycle mutations stay
  protected;
- UUIDs are the identity boundary; presentation identifiers are not identity.

These rules must be asserted through the Jaflow context/status behavior, not
only through direct database queries.

## Operational Rules From `AGENTS.md`

The reference agent protocol also establishes operational contracts that must
remain visible where applicable:

- answer the user's actual request before workflow exposition;
- orient from focus and context before material workflow actions;
- preserve project and session isolation;
- keep normal successful no-op output quiet;
- emit state changes on stdout;
- emit failures on stderr with corrective guidance;
- require an `OUTCOME` before completion;
- do not close a task silently;
- use generated agent artifacts through their templates;
- treat banners, warnings, tips, and errors as operational signals.

These rules are part of the agent-facing integration contract. They do not
require the native engine to reproduce the reference implementation's Python
or shell structure.

## Completion Gate

The parity initiative is complete only when:

- every behavior in the coverage map has a real contract test or an explicit
  documented compatibility decision;
- project and session isolation are tested at the command/API boundary;
- security restrictions have regression and mutation coverage;
- cache and context inheritance behavior are covered;
- documentation describes user-facing changes;
- `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and the project's race validation pass;
- the final task contains an English `OUTCOME` describing evidence and known
  residual risks.

Until these conditions are met, a green build is not feature completion.
